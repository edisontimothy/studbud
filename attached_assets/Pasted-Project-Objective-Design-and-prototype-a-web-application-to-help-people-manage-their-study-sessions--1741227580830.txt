Project Objective
Design and prototype a web application to help people manage their study sessions.

Target Audience
We know this online platform will be useful for students. Identify which sub-
group(s) of this audience you think could benefit the most

Background
Prior thought and planning is essential for productive study sessions. There are many theories about planning and managing study sessions, and even more online tools which put these theories into practice. Our competitive analysis shows that these tools fall into two distinct categories:

1. Planning Tools (e.g. study calendars, time schedules)
2. Content Tools (e.g. flash cards, quiz apps)
3. 
Studbud is designed as we identified a gap in the market for a platform which focusses on managing individual study sessions. This web-based application should combine planning and content functionality, to equip students with the tools they need for a productive study session.

Managing Study and Work Sessions
There are 3 areas of focus for your web-application:
1. Task Management
Dividing up tasks, visualising priorities
2. Time Management
Just like study planning methods, there are many methods for managing time. We know that study is
effective for a limited amount of productive time, after which it is important to take a break.
3. Content Management
This is specific to the type of study or work you are doing, unlike task and time management which
are more universal.
